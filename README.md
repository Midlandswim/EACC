# EACC Projekt
Engineers Against Climate Change Club @ BCA

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani and EACC <br />
Advisor: Mr. Joesph Barbetta (BCA) & Mr. Michael Liva (BCA) <br />
Context: The Bergen County Academies' Engineers Against Climate Change Club <br />
Projekt Name: Automatic Enviroment for Flora (AEF2) <br />
Start Date: January 1, 2022 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research projekt and its related fields of engineering. This club, was founded by myself and 3 other friends, Benjamin Brnic, Vedic Patel, and Thomas Soltys, with the goal of efficently and effictly addressing climate chnage utilizing our aquired skills/experiences in engineering. We hoped to use our time and energy to figure out ways to address climate chnage related issues. After contacting Rutherford Township in Bergen County, New Jersey, we were able to come up with an automatic enviroment for flora, which is compeltely self sustatining, requiring minimal maintanece. This was made to be compact and cost effective, with sustainability and effecieny in mind. This projekt has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
