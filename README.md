# EACC Projekt
Engineers Against Climate Change Club @ BCA

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani and EACC <br />
Advisor: Mr. Joesph Barbetta (BCA) & Mr. Micheal Liva (BCA) <br />
Context: The Bergen County Academies' Engineers Against Climate Change Club <br />
Projekt Name: Automatic Enviroment for Flora (AEF2) <br />
Start Date: January 1, 2022 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research projekt and its related fields of engineering. 
This projekt has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
