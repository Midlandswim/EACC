# EACC Projekt
Engineers Against Climate Change Club at the Bergen County Academies

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani and EACC <br />
Advisor: Mr. Joesph Barbetta (BCA) & Mr. Michael Liva (BCA) <br />
Context: The Bergen County Academies' Engineers Against Climate Change Club <br />
Projekt Name: Automatic Enviroment for Flora (AEF2) <br />
Start Date: January 1, 2022 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research project and its related fields of engineering. This club, was founded by myself and three other friends, Benjamin Brnic, Vedic Patel, and Thomas Soltys, with the goal of efficiently and effectively addressing climate change utilizing our acquired skills/experiences in engineering. We hoped to use our time and energy to figure out ways to address climate change-related issues. After contacting Rutherford Township in Bergen County, New Jersey, we were able to come up with an automatic environment for flora, which is mostly self-sustaining, requiring minimal maintenance. This was made to be compact and cost-effective, with sustainability and efficiency in mind. This project has no end date as innovation never ends; rather, it continues until the idea is forgotten, and I hope that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
